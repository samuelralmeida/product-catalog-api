## Dynamic reloading

App uses [gow](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) to reload project automaticaly

- `make install-binares` installs gow
- `make run` runs app using gow

[modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) is also an interesting alternative. It can be more general and more configurable than **gow**.
